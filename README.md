# UCI_homework
Various Projects and Homework assigned while at the University of California Cyber Security Bootcamp. The course covered governance to live Penetration Tests and report writing.
The Class notes I took will possibly be added at a later time.
The Course required the creation of an updated git repository, this is the result.
If any questions or concerns about any part of anything please raise an issue and I will respond accordingly.
